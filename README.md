<h1 align="center"> ✨ Hi everybirdies 🐦✨ </h1>

I'm Yavanna (it comes from "The Silmarillion") 🧝‍♀️

🌱 I'm currently doing my intership at Glow-up <br />
⚡ I'm at the end of my training at BeCode in Brussels <br />
💻 I'm mostly interested to learn about front-end development but I'm excited about back-end as well ~ <br />
🎮 I'm always curious and open about video games, I even did a game dev formation so I could discover a part of this world <br />
🍵 I'm a tea lover from morning until the night
